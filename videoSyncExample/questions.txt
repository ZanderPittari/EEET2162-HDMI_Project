QUESTIONS: 


 - do we need interlaced or noninterlaced video standard?

 ===================================================================
 
A 1024 x 600 resolution display requires 614400 memory locations, with each location having a number of possible colors. 
The number of bits needed to describe the available colors is called bits per pixel (bpp). 
24 bits can describe 16777216 colors (known as true color). 
A panel with 614400 24-bit locations requires a 1800 KB frame buffer.

The LCD controller paints frames from left to right and from top to bottom. Signals used on a typical LCD display include:

HSYNC: Horizontal synch (FPLINE) indicates the end of a line and the beginning of the next line.
VSYNC: Vertical synch (FPFRAME) indicates the end of the current frame. The next line index should restart at zero in the upper-left corner.
DE: Data enable. The data in the bus is valid and must be latched using the PIXCLK signal. While itâ€™s active, each pulse draws a pixel.
PIXCLK: Specifies the placing of RGB data on the bus.
RGB data: Red, green, and blue pixel data. Usually 24 data lines for RGB888.

===================================================================
Typical timing parameters include:

Horizontal Back Porch (HBP): Number of PIXCLK pulses between HSYNC signal and the first valid pixel data.
Horizontal Front porch (HFP): Number of PIXCLK pulses between the last valid pixel data in the line and the next HSYNC pulse.
Vertical Back Porch (VBP): Number of lines (HSYNC pulses) from a VSYNC signal to the first valid line.
Vertical Front Porch (VFP): Number of lines (HSYNC pulses) between the last valid line of the frame and the next VSYNC pulse.
VSYNC length: Number of HSYNC pulses when a VSYNC signal is active.
HSYNC length: Number of PIXCLK pulses when a HSYNC signal is active.
Active frame width (hactive): Horizontal resolution.
Active frame height (vactive): Vertical resolution.
